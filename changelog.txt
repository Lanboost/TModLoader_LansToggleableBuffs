v. 0.2.5:
	- Changed the "remove rendering of buffs" toggle to only remove "toggleable" buffs.
v. 0.2.4:
	- Added reset command (for testing)
	- Added "re-application" delay of 600 ticks (10 seconds) to prevent stacking of (mutually) exclusive buffs.
	  (Calamity "Cadence" and "Lifeforce" for example)
	  Note: Not the nicest solution, but the easiest. Might have to revisit this later.
	- Added "vanilla" environmental buffs.
	- Added hotkey to remove rendering of buffs.
V. 0.2.3:
	- Fixed a issue with the panel not resizing correctly nor staying in the center of the screen
	- Added config
	- Added Debuffs for mods
V. 0.2.2:
	- Wrapped the UI inside a "badly done" scrollpanel, hopefully this did not fuck everything
